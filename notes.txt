go through the training data.
create the combined_df
check how many compunds there are that have no intersection



prepare datasets: 
    creates tests_df list and the combined_df

train_multi:
    creates the dataloader from the combined and calls the test data loader creator

idea is to creat a custom combined_train. 
Do this by saving the datasets and loading them in after.

Other idea ws to monkey patch them in.

ok it loads, I will have to create a training parameter that specifies where to take the train/test from
